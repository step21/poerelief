## Data

* in the current dataset that is live, many epigraphic documents were dropped, as they did not display well due to hardly any text being present.
* there is data from 137 cemetery locations (this might be out of date, but was current as of the inception of this project in 2014)
* these locations were used to compile a dataset of 25.372 epigraphics records based on the data from the Steinheim Institute
* thse records were then cleaned up as outlined above, which results in 16.171 records in the live dataset


Required packages:

 - see requirements{2/3}.txt

To Install/Run

- git clone or download the repository
- `cd` into cloned directory
- virtualenv poe (to create a new evironment)
- source poe/bin/activate to activate the new environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary python packages
- Download the database (cleaned up) as used in production, and put it into the subdirectory poerelief (https://chaostal.de/~step21/teidb_dev.sqlite)
- The code is a bit unorganized, but running `python run.py` in the subdirectory poerelief should start the main app
- To enable proper links even for development, the dev app has to be accessed on localhost instead of 127.0.0.1 (this is set in config.py, but afaik it is not possible to set it to an IP)
